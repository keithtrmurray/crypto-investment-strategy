            <p class="card-text">
                Cryptocurrency investments are volatile and high-risk. The cryptocurrency market is subject to rapid and 
                substantial price swings, and past performance is not indicative of future results. You should be prepared 
                to lose all the money you invest in cryptocurrencies. Never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
